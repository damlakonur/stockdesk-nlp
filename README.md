| **Model 3: Prediction Phrase Extractor (NER)** | Extracts textual prediction phrases from tweets | [prediction-text-ner-bist30](https://huggingface.co/engibeer/prediction-text-ner-bist30) |
| **Model 4: Sentiment Analysis** | Analyzes sentiment of prediction phrases (positive/negative) | [prediction-sentiment-bist30](https://huggingface.co/engibeer/prediction-sentiment-bist30) |
